# GeePay Analytics Dashboard Hackathon Submission

## Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the GeePay Analytics Dashboard Hackathon! This project showcases my skills in building a responsive and interactive analytics dashboard using React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Headless UI. By avoiding heavy frameworks and dependencies on UI libraries, I've demonstrated my ability to create a sleek and functional dashboard from scratch.

## Features

1. **Dark and Light Mode**: The dashboard supports both dark and light modes, providing users with a customizable viewing experience.
2. **Interactive Table**: The dashboard features an interactive table that allows users to view and analyze data seamlessly.
3. **Live URL**: You can access the live dashboard at [GeePay Hackathon Submission](https://geepay-hackathon-submission.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- React: Used for building the frontend components and managing state efficiently.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling the dashboard with minimalistic yet visually appealing designs.
- TypeScript: Implemented for type safety and enhanced development experience.
- Headless UI: Leveraged for building accessible and customizable UI components without heavy framework dependencies.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains reusable React components for building the dashboard layout, charts, and tables.
- `src/styles`: Houses Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom styles for styling the components.
- `src/data`: Stores sample data for populating the analytics dashboard.
